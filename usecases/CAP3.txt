h1. WOS-UC-TA3-005: Background Execution

Author: Andre Paul

Actors: User

h2. Description

Applications get the possibility to run code in the background that keeps running even when the main app is closed

h2. Preconditions

The Application that wants to execute something in background is running.

h2. Flow

# The Application assigns code that should be executed in the background to the System (e.g. listing to temperature sensors).
# The main Application is closed by the User.
# The background code notifies the Webinos Runtime that the main Application should be launched (e.g., because it is over 30 degrees now).
# The Webinos Runtime informs the User about the occurrence of a certain event that triggers launching an Application.
# The User decides whether he want to launch the Application or not (do nothing).
# If the User chose to do so, the Application is launched


h2. Postconditions

Code is executed in the background without the need for a running main Application. For the User the background execution is not visible.
