Author: Heiko Desruelle

Actors: User,Application

h2. Description

Applications should be able to obtain a filtered list of entities based on their physical and social proximity. Physical proximity is based on the entities location and expressed in terms of a certain physical range. Social proximity on the other hand, focuses on peoples social connections rather than the location-based aspect of physical proximity.


h2. Preconditions

The user's personal zone has a list of acceptable devices, according to his preferences.

h2. Flow

# User uses an application and selects an option to access media files from another device.
#  Application queries the webinos runtime for an overview of the user's devices with the required capabilities within a specified, preferential physical range.
# The webinos runtime requests the list of devices.
# The personal zone hub executes the query and returns the resulting list of devices.
# Application presents the results ordered by proximity, availability and capabilities.
# The User selects a device.
# Application instructs the webinos runtime to access media files from the discovered device.


h2. Postconditions

The identified media is available on the requesting user's device.
