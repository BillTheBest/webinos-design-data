Author: Heiko Desruelle

Actors: User,Application

h2. Description

Applications should be able to get a filtered list of entities based on their physical and social proximity. Physical proximity is based on the entities location and expressed in terms of a certain physical range. Social proximity on the other hand, focuses on peoples social connections rather than the location-based aspect of physical proximity.

h2. Preconditions

The User is visiting another user. Both users have webinos enabled devices.  The user has a list of acceptable devices, according to the personal physical and social proximity preferences.

h2. Flow

# User uses an application and selects an option to obtain a media file from another device
# Application queries the webinos runtime for an overview of authorised devices with the required capabilities within a certain physical range.
# The webinos runtime requests the list of devices from the personal zone hub.
# webinos executes the query and returns the resulting list of devices.
# Application queries webinos for devices within both a preferential physical and social proximity.
# The webinos runtime requests the list of devices from the personal zone hub.
# webinos executes the query and returns the resulting list of devices.
# Application presents the results ordered by social/physical proximity, availability, capabilities and associated users. 
# The User selects a device.
# The Application instructs the webinos to obtain the media file.

h2. Postconditions

The media file is obtained from the device selected within the preferred social proximity.
