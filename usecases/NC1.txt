h1. WOS-UC-TA6-003: Content Adaptation

Author: Christian Fuhrhop

Actors: User

h2. Description

The system needs to be able to adapt the presentation of content to the capabilities of the system the content is presented on.


h2. Preconditions

An application is showing a user interface that benefits from adapting to the capabilities of the device. 

h2. Flow

# A number of users participate in a video conference,
# The video conference application asks for local device characteristics to the local PZP
# The video conference application adapts what each user can see on the base of the specific device characteristics

h2. Postconditions

All participants of the video conference receive a user experience that is most appropriate for their device and environment.

* Users with large screen devices (such as TVs) will see the video streams of all participating users in equal size.
* Users with medium size screens (desktop computers) will see the current speaker in a large window and the streams of all participants in smaller thumbnail windows.
* Users with mobile phones will only see the stream of the current speaker.
* Users that are driving cars will not see a video stream, to avoid distractions, but will only receive an audio stream with additional acoustic cues to identify the current speaker.
