Author: Anders Isberg
Review: Andr√© Paul

Actors: Application

h2. Description

In addition to application based publishing of events webinos itself is able to publish a set of system events like, for example, system was booted, WiFi connection becomes available, low battery level, after a certain interval, at a given timer or others. A full list of events should be defined in the related requirement and specification documents.
    

h2. Preconditions

Webinos is running on at least one device and an application that wants to be informed about webinos events is currently running.
      

h2. Flow

# Application subscribes to specific events that are published by the webinos runtime.
# webinos detects that conditions for a specific webinos event are met (e.g., WiFi connectivity, low battery level or other pre defined and specified webinos system events).
# webinos creates an event that describes the occurred conditions.
# webinos publishes the event.
# webinos checks which applications have been subscribed to the event in question.
# The event is distributed to all subscribing applications on the same or other devices, including the Application.

h2. Postconditions

Application has received the published information.
