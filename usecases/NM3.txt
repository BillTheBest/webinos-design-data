Author: Andre Paul, based on WOS-UC-TA4-002

Actors: Application,User

h2. Description

webinos allows applications to publish and subscribe to application based events. In addition to this, webinos itself publishes certain events where applications can be registered to. webinos allows a permanent subscription to events so that applications that are not running are automatically started based on the event and afterwards the application can receive the event.

h2. Preconditions

An application subscribes to a wifi connectivity event with the request to be automatically started if it is not already running.

h2. Flow

# User terminates the application.
# webinos detects that conditions for a specific webinos event for wifi connectivity is met.
# webinos creates an event that describes the occurred condition.
# webinos publishes the event.
# webinos checks which applications have been subscribed to the event in question.
# webinos starts applications that are registered to the event but that are currently not running.
# The event is distributed to subscribing applications running on the same or on other, remote, devices, including the application.

h2. Postconditions

The application has been started, is reachable, and has received the published information.
