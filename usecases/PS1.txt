Author: Christian Nord, Andre Paul

Actors: User, Application

h2. Description

A user automatically logs in to external services.

h2. Preconditions

The user has already registered with the service and the service has been added to his webinos account.

h2. Flow

# The user points his Internet application, e.g., the browser, to a service end-point or runs a webinos application/runtime that provides access to the service.
# In the background the webinos runtime provides the service a unique identity identifier (Certificates) when the user connects to the service
# By using the offered identity the service can, by accessing the webinos runtime for the user, determine if the user is already a registered user and grant access

The user is granted access to the service without login prompting.
