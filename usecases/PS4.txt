h1. WOS-UC-TA4-005: Store Content in a Secure File Storage

Author: Anders Isberg
Review: Andr√© Paul

Actors: User, Application

h2. Description

Applications may need to store application specific data or other content in a protected storage space. This storage space should be only accessible by the related application so that no other application can access or manipulate the stored data and even the user has no access.

h2. Preconditions

An application that needs to store private data is available to the user.

h2. Flow

# The end user starts the application
# The application retrieves private data that must be stored in a protected environment (e.g., private user data provided by the user, application specific data generated by the application itself, or media files or other content)
# The application requests API access to protected storage space
# The policy manager inside the PZP checks if the application has write access to the protected storage, and grant the access on the base of configured policies
# The application starts to write content to the protected storage space.

h2. Postconditions

The content stored in the protected storage can be accessed for read and write operations by the original application but not by the user or by other webinos or native applications.
