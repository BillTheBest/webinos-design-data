h1. WOS-UC-TA9-002: Interpreting policies and making access control decisions

Author: John Lyle

Actors: User, Application 

h2. Description

A freshly installed application wants to share his photos through a shared repository. This task is controlled by webinos policies.

h2. Preconditions

User has a tablet PC running webinos
User has a photo collection on his tablet PC which he would like to share with other people (Users) who are connected.
The webinos runtime has a set of policies installed.  These are not contradictory or ambiguous, so a decision can always be made based on their content.


h2. Flow

# The User has installed a new photo-sharing application
# The application automatically tries to upload his photos to a shared repository
# Accessing photos stored on the webinos device his tablet pc  results in an access-control request to the webinos runtime.
# webinos runtime takes the event (application X accessing File F) and checks against the set of policies (PS) installed that are present in the PZP. In this case, the set of policies in the PZP is fresh and valid, so the PZP does not need to update it to the PZH to made the correct access control decision
# The policies allow this action, and the application resumes uploading photos 
# Other users who are connected can access these photos

h2. Postconditions

The photos are available for sharing with other online friends, on the base of the webinos policies
